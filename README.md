This  DevOps project established a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for Spring Boot application, leveraging industry-standard tools to automate key processes. The pipeline includes build and test automation (Jenkins, Maven), quality and security analysis (SonarQube, Trivy), artifact management (JFrog Artifactory), containerized deployments (ArgoCD, Docker Hub), and centralized monitoring and logging (Prometheus, Grafana, EFK Stack). This integrated approach enhances development efficiency, code quality, and application security.
